STABLE is an energy system model of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM)
bulk transmission network. It models the flow of energy between market participants.
Technology types in the model are aggregations of
 - generation technologies,
 - energy storage technologies,
 - transmission, and
 - energy consumers.

This package creates a data model interface to (Dieter.jl)[https://github.com/jd-foster/Dieter.jl].
